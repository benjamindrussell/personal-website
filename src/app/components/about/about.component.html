                Hey there! I'm Ben, a Computer Science student at the University of Dayton. At UD I'm on the Mars Rover Team and the Rock Climbing Team. This Summer I'm doing a
                Software Engineering Internship at Riverside Research here in Dayton, and during the school year I work
                as part-time web developer for UD's student-run business Flyer Enterprises.

                My current interests include web development, space tech, and embedded systems programming. I also love to compete in Hackathons and tinker with different Linux distributions on old computers. When I'm not coding I spend my time rock climbing, hiking, reading, solving Rubik's cubes, and spending time with friends.
